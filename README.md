## My Projects

1. My site is https://github.com/Atikin-NT/My-site. Two years ago, I was interested in web development, so I decided to create my own blog. It worked on the niktech.site address, but I got tired of writing articles, there was no feedback from users (no one read), so I decided to stop supporting it. But you can see the code in the **My-site** repository

2. Escrow. I worked in a team that developed an escrow servise based on smart contracts that do not need a middleman in comparison to centralized competitors. It allows making safe peer-2-peer purchases with a minimum fee and maximal level of trust. The funds are frozen in the escrow account until the buyer confirms that the product or service was received. In this project, I was responsible for the backend and database architecture
